# Predicting Student At-Risk Status Using Non-Traditional Data Sources

## Overview

This project aims to predict student academic performance and identify students at risk of failure.  Instead of relying solely on traditional academic data, this project integrates non-traditional data sources such as social media engagement metrics and library resource utilization to create a more comprehensive and potentially more accurate predictive model. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to determine the effectiveness of incorporating these alternative data points.


## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```


## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., plots showing feature importance, model performance curves) in the `output` directory. These visualizations aid in understanding the model's performance and the contribution of different features.  The specific output files and their names may vary depending on the model and analysis performed.
